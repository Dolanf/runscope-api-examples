Runscope API Helper Examples
============
A collection of sample apps and other helper projects for 
learning how to use the [Runscope API](https://www.runscope.com/docs/api).

Obtaining an Access Token
------------
An access token is required to use the Runscope API (including the 
sample apps in this repo). To create a personal access token,
login to your Runscope account and navigate to [https://www.runscope.com/applications](https://www.runscope.com/applications).
Then click ```Create Application``` -- provide any name for your app. 
For website and callback URLs, you can just type in ```http://127.0.0.1```
as placeholders (unless you're already building a full web application with
OAuth support). After you've created the application, you'll find a 
personal access token at the bottom has been created for you.

By default, this access token has full OAuth scopes -- including all
read/write operations. Keep this access token 
confidential!
